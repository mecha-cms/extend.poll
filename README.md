Poll Extension for Mecha
========================

> Poll is a unified extension used to handle all tasks related to documenting user’s input. Surely you’ve seen features such as _like_ and _reaction_ buttons on Facebook and on most portal websites, _plus one_ on Google+, _feedback_ on documentation/support websites. This extension brings them all together into a simpler yet more extensible system in a single folder.
