description: >
  Poll is a unified extension used to handle all tasks related to documenting the user’s input.
  Surely you’ve seen features such as _like_ and _reaction_ buttons on Facebook and on most portal
  websites, _plus one_ on Google+, _feedback_ on documentation/support websites. This extension
  brings them all together into a simpler yet more extensible system in a single folder.
